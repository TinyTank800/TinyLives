# **About**

Want to give your players a challenge? Why not limit the lives they get like hardcore but with a twist! Inspired by the popular series called the 3rd Life(Third Life/Last Life/Limited Life) Series by Grian, this plugin takes those ideas and makes it usable on spigot servers with tons of customization and is not limited to 3 lives!

* Lightweight
* PlaceholderAPI support
* Fully customizable
* Unlimited control
* Many systems to use
