# **About**

Want to give your players a challenge? Why not limit the lives they get like hardcore but maybe with a few more lives. Well this plugin is for you. Inspired by the popular series called the 3rd Life(Third Life/Last Life) Series by Grian, this plugin takes the idea and makes it usable on spigot servers with tons of customization and not limited to 3 lives!

* Lightweight
* PlaceholderAPI support
* Fully customizable
* Unlimited control
* Many systems to use
